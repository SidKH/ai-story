Write a short story in the style of Ernest Hemingway.

Set the story in an early 20th-century coastal fishing village, focusing on a solitary, weathered protagonist. Begin with a concise introduction (3-5 sentences) to establish the scene and mood. After the introduction, pause and wait for my input on what happens next (e.g., a single sentence or a detailed description).

Continue the story based on my input, maintaining Hemingwayâ€™s style and tone, and incorporating vivid sensory details and understated emotions. Ensure each continuation builds naturally from my input and the established narrative.
